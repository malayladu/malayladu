### Hi, I'm Malay üëã  

I bring over **14 years** of experience in creating software solutions that address **real problems for real people**. My philosophy revolves around **thinking big, starting small**, and consistently applying this approach in my daily life. I've had the privilege of developing **25+ products** that are actively used by more than **100,000** users.

As a Full-Stack web developer, I specialize in crafting interactive web applications using a variety of technologies, including PHP, WordPress, Laravel, NodeJS, VueJS, ReactJS, and Tailwind CSS.

Beyond my work in the tech world, I'm a responsible son, a caring husband, and the proud father of loving two daughters. When I'm not fixated on a computer screen, you can find me spending quality time with my family, engaging in cricket matches, on the badminton court, cycling, and making a valiant effort not to become the world's worst dancer. üòâ

I have a passion for writing, and I enjoy sharing my insights and knowledge through articles, which you can find on my [website](https://malayladu.com).

#### üî≠ Here are some notable projects I've been involved in:

I have also built various [ActiveCollab](https://activecollab.com) extensions. You can find it [here](https://www.appsmagnet.com/activecollab-main/).
